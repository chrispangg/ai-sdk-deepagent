- [x] **CompositeBackend** - Route files to different backends by path prefix
- [x] **Prompt Caching** - Anthropic cache control support
- [x] **Tool Result Eviction** - Large results saved to filesystem to prevent overflow
- [x] **Auto-Summarization** - Compress old messages when approaching token limits
- [x] **Event Streaming** - Granular events for tool calls, file ops, subagents
- [x] **CLI Interface** - Interactive terminal with Ink (React)
- [x] **SandboxBackendProtocol** - Execute shell commands in isolated environments (`BaseSandbox`, `LocalSandbox`)
- [x] **Execute Tool** - Run commands via sandbox backend (auto-added for sandbox backends)
- [x] **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** - Interrupt agent for tool approval/rejection via `interruptOn` config; CLI supports Safe/Auto-approve modes
- [x] **Checkpointer Support** - Persist agent state between invocations (pause/resume); includes `MemorySaver`, `FileSaver`, `KeyValueStoreSaver`; CLI session management via `--session` flag
- [x] **Web Tools** - `web_search` (Tavily API), `http_request`, `fetch_url` with HTML → Markdown conversion; follows LangChain approval pattern (approval required for `web_search` and `fetch_url` only)
- [x] **Middleware Architecture** - AI SDK v6 `wrapLanguageModel` support for logging, caching, RAG, guardrails; supports single or array of middleware; non-breaking addition via optional `middleware` parameter
- [x] **Skills System** - Dynamic skill loading from SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter; progressive disclosure pattern (metadata in system prompt, full content loaded on-demand); supports user-level and project-level skills with override logic
- [x] **Agent Memory Middleware** - Long-term memory from agent.md files (plain markdown); two-tier system (user: `~/.deepagents/{agentId}/agent.md`, project: `[git-root]/.deepagents/agent.md`); closure-based caching for performance; auto-creates user directory, requests approval for project directory; supports additional .md files for specialized context; skills also load from `.deepagents/{agentId}/skills/`
- [x] **readRaw Backend Method** - Raw FileData without line formatting (implemented in all backends)
- [x] **Per-Subagent Interrupt Config** - Different HITL rules per subagent (via `SubAgent.interruptOn`)
- [x] **Structured Output** - `output` parameter for typed agent responses via Zod schemas
  - Uses ToolLoopAgent's native output parsing
  - Full TypeScript type inference
  - Works alongside all existing features
  - Non-breaking optional parameter
  - Supports subagent structured output delegation
- [x] **Fix `options.messages` Implementation** ⚠️ **[BUG]**
  - **Why**: `DeepAgentOptions.messages` is defined in types but NOT used in implementation; library only supports checkpoint-based persistence (threadId + checkpointer)
  - **Impact**: Users expect to pass conversation history via `messages` parameter (standard AI SDK pattern), but it's silently ignored
  - **Effort**: 1 day, add message handling to agent initialization
  - **Workaround**: Manually prepend message history to prompt or use checkpointer
  - **Note**: Should support both patterns: explicit `messages` array AND checkpoint-based persistence
- [x] **ToolLoopAgent Constructor Passthrough**
  - **Why**: Enable full AI SDK v6 ToolLoopAgent features (custom stopWhen, maxRetries, etc.) while keeping DeepAgent harness
  - **Impact**: Better flexibility for advanced users, maintains AI SDK compatibility
  - **Effort**: 1-2 days, add passthrough options to DeepAgentOptions
  - **Note**: Should preserve DeepAgent defaults (systemPrompt, tools) but allow overrides
- [x] **Subagent Web Tools Access** ⚠️ **[BUG]**
  - **Why**: Subagents spawned via `task` tool don't inherit web tools (`web_search`, `http_request`, `fetch_url`), limiting their capabilities
  - **Impact**: Subagents cannot perform web research or API calls, forcing parent agent to handle all web operations
  - **Effort**: 1 day, ensure web tools are passed to subagent creation in `src/tools/subagent.ts`
  - **Note**: Should respect parent's `interruptOn` config for web tool approvals
- [x] **Provider Options Passthrough** - Support AI SDK provider-specific options
  - **Why**: Enable provider-specific features (e.g., Anthropic's thinking mode, OpenAI's reasoning effort, etc.) without hardcoding in DeepAgent
  - **Impact**: Better flexibility for advanced users, maintains compatibility with AI SDK provider features
  - **Effort**: 1 day, add `providerOptions` parameter to `CreateDeepAgentParams` and pass through to ToolLoopAgent
  - **Note**: Should work alongside existing `generationOptions` and `loopControl` passthrough
- [x] **Architectural Refactoring** - Comprehensive refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce cognitive load (2025-12-21)
  - **Phase 1**: Type System Modularisation - Split monolithic `types.ts` (1,670 lines) into focused modules:
    - `src/types/core.ts` - Core agent types (12 exports)
    - `src/types/backend.ts` - Backend and filesystem types (11 exports + function)
    - `src/types/events.ts` - All 35 event types + unions (36 exports)
    - `src/types/subagent.ts` - Subagent infrastructure (5 exports)
    - `src/types/index.ts` - Re-exports for backward compatibility
    - Main `src/types.ts` now serves as clean re-export layer
  - **Phase 2**: Error Handling Standardisation - Added `success: boolean` discriminant to result types:
    - Updated `WriteResult` and `EditResult` interfaces
    - Added `isWriteSuccess()` and `isEditSuccess()` type guards
    - Updated all 6 backend implementations consistently
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `result.error` checks
  - **Phase 3**: Function Decomposition - Broke down large methods into focused functions:
    - `streamWithEvents`: 348 → 178 lines (49% reduction, exceeded 48% target)
    - Extracted 7 helper methods: `loadCheckpointContext()`, `buildMessageArray()`, `buildStreamTextOptions()`, and 4 tool creation methods
    - `createTools`: 59 lines → 27 lines main orchestrator + 4 focused category methods
    - Code now reads as high-level workflow with details encapsulated
  - **Impact**: Significantly improved maintainability, testability, and code readability
  - **All Tests**: 227/227 passing (100%), TypeScript compilation successful
  - **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible
- [x] **Remove `as any` Type Assertions** - Eliminate unsafe type casts throughout codebase
  - **Why**: `as any` bypasses TypeScript's type safety, hiding potential bugs and reducing code quality
  - **Impact**: Better type safety, fewer runtime errors, improved developer experience
  - **Effort**: 1-2 days, audit all files and replace with proper types/generics
  - **Note**: Focus on `src/` directory first, then examples and tests
  - **Implementation**: Completed 2025-12-21
    - Fixed 1 instance in `src/utils/patch-tool-calls.ts` - proper AI SDK ToolResultPart structure
    - Fixed 6 instances in `examples/with-structured-output.ts` - added type-safe utilities
    - Created `src/types/structured-output.ts` with 4 type-safe utility functions
    - All 227 tests pass, zero regressions, TypeScript compilation clean
    - Test files left unchanged as requested (86 instances remain in tests)
- [x] **Error Handling Standardisation** - Consistent error patterns across modules
  - **Why**: Mix of throwing vs returning error objects creates inconsistency
  - **Impact**: Predictable error handling, better debugging experience
  - **Approach**:
    - Define error type hierarchy (e.g., `DeepAgentError`, `BackendError`, `ToolError`)
    - Standardise on throwing for exceptional cases, returning `Result<T, E>` for expected failures
    - Add error codes for programmatic handling
  - **Effort**: 2-3 days, cross-cutting refactor
  - **Implementation**: Completed as part of Architectural Refactoring (Phase 2, 2025-12-21)
    - Added `success: boolean` discriminant to `WriteResult` and `EditResult` interfaces
    - All 6 backend implementations consistently return standardized results
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing error checking patterns

## 🚧 To Implement

### Critical

### High Priority

- [ ] **Async Backend Methods** ⚠️ **[BREAKING]** - Full async variants of all backend operations
  - **Why**: Current sync methods block event loop, limits scalability
  - **Impact**: Better performance for I/O-heavy operations
  - **Effort**: 2-3 days, requires refactoring all backends + tests
  - **Note**: Schedule for next major version (v0.2.0 or v1.0.0)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **StoreBackend** - LangGraph BaseStore adapter for cross-thread persistence
  - **Note**: Lower priority since PersistentBackend already handles similar use cases

- [ ] **Cloud Sandbox Integrations** - Modal, Runloop, Daytona providers
  - **Note**: Wait for user demand before implementing

### Lower Priority

- [ ] **Context Schema** - Custom state types beyond default
- [ ] **Compiled Subagents** - Pre-built runnable subagent instances
- [ ] **Custom Tool Descriptions** - Override default tool descriptions
- [ ] **Cache Support** - Response caching via BaseCache

---

## 📋 Future Architectural Improvements

### High Impact (Future Major Release)

- [ ] **Event System Refactor** - Implement scalable event bus with metadata support
  - **Why**: Current event system (120+ usages across 8 files) creates complex data flows that are hard to trace; tools directly call `onEvent` callback creating tight coupling
  - **Impact**: Better debugging, filtering, and extensibility for complex multi-agent interactions
  - **Approach**: Hybrid Event Bus + Metadata pattern:
    - Centralised `EventBus` to decouple producers/consumers
    - Type-safe subscriptions per event type (`subscribeToType<T>`)
    - Event metadata with `correlationId` for tracing subagent interactions
    - Lightweight context (source, stepNumber) without full event sourcing overhead
  - **Effort**: 3-4 days, significant refactoring of event handling throughout codebase
  - **Reference**: See `docs/tickets/012_architectural_health_assessment/research.md` for detailed options analysis

- [ ] **Enhanced Skills Ecosystem** - Align with Agent Skills open standard
  - **Why**: Current skills system only parses `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter; doesn't support optional fields or resource directories
  - **Impact**: Full spec compliance enables interoperability with other Agent Skills-compatible tools
  - **Approach**: Implement [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) specification:
    - Add optional fields: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`
    - Support resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`
    - Implement progressive disclosure: metadata (~100 tokens) → instructions (<5000 tokens) → resources (on-demand)
    - Add skill validation (name format: lowercase, hyphens, 1-64 chars)
  - **Effort**: 3-4 days, extend `SkillMetadata` type and `listSkills` implementation
  - **Reference**: <https://agentskills.io/specification>, <https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills>

### Medium Impact (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] **Configuration Builder Pattern** - Simplify complex CreateDeepAgentParams
  - **Why**: 17+ optional properties create overwhelming configuration surface
  - **Impact**: Better developer experience, clearer API
  - **Approach**: Fluent builder pattern with logical grouping

- [ ] **Consistent Naming Conventions** - Standardise factory function names
  - **Why**: Mix of `createXTool` vs `createX` reduces predictability
  - **Impact**: Better developer experience, easier to discover APIs
  - **Approach**: Adopt consistent pattern (prefer `createXTool` for tools, `createX` for non-tools)

---

## ❌ Won't Support (AI SDK Limitations)

- **LangGraph State Reducers** - AI SDK doesn't have annotated state schemas with custom reducers
- **LangGraph Command Pattern** - No direct equivalent for `Command({ update: {...} })`
- **Native Graph Compilation** - AI SDK uses ToolLoopAgent, not compiled state graphs
- **Thread-level Store Namespacing** - Would require custom implementation

---
